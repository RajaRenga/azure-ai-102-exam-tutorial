# Select the Appropriate Applied AI Services

## Overview

Applied AI services in Azure provide pre-built AI functionality that can be incorporated into applications and workflows. These services include vision, speech, language, and decision services. This tutorial will focus on selecting the appropriate service for a vision solution.

## Concepts and Definitions

- **Applied AI services**: These are pre-built AI services provided by Azure that can be incorporated into applications and workflows.
- **Vision services**: These are AI services that can analyze images and videos to identify objects, people, text, scenes, and activities, as well as to generate high-quality thumbnails or extract rich information from images.

## Key Features and Functionality

Applied AI services in Azure offer a wide range of features and functionality. Here are some of the key ones:

- **Image and video analysis**: Applied AI services can analyze images and videos to identify objects, people, text, scenes, and activities. They can also generate high-quality thumbnails or extract rich information from images.
- **Custom models**: With Applied AI services, you can build and train custom models to suit your specific needs.

## Use Cases and Scenarios

Applied AI services can be used in a variety of scenarios. Here are a few examples:

- **Retail**: In retail, Applied AI services can be used to analyze customer behavior, predict trends, and personalize shopping experiences.
- **Healthcare**: In healthcare, these services can be used to analyze medical images, predict patient outcomes, and automate administrative tasks.

## Best Practices and Guidelines

Here are some best practices and guidelines for using Applied AI services:

- **Understand the services**: Before using any Applied AI service, make sure you understand what it does and how it works. This will help you use the service effectively.
- **Use custom models**: If the pre-built models do not meet your needs, consider building and training a custom model.

## Integration and Interoperability

Applied AI services in Azure are designed to be integrated with other Azure services and with external systems. They can be used in conjunction with services like Azure Functions, Azure Logic Apps, and Azure Machine Learning. They can also be integrated with external systems using APIs and SDKs.

## Limitations and Constraints

While Applied AI services offer a lot of functionality, they do have some limitations and constraints. For example, there may be limits on the size and format of the data you can use with these services. There may also be constraints related to privacy and security, especially when dealing with sensitive data.
